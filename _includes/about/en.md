> Compromise where you can.

> But where you can't,don't.

> Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right.

> Even if the whole world is telling you to move,
 
> it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree,
 
> look them in the eye and say.
 
> "No,you move."
 
>  ————Peggy Carter
